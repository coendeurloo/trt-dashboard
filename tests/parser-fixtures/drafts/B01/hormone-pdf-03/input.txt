[REDACTED_NAME] | 01-01-1985 | tgwajmc +44 (0)207 183 3718 www.londonmedicallaboratory.com 5 of 40 Doctor's Report Dear [REDACTED], Thank you for coming to us for your testing needs. Please find your blood test results enclosed. I've reviewed your blood test results today and some of the blood test results lie outside the normal range and one requires your immediate attention. I’ve summarised the main findings here, but please be aware that I am unable to be more specific as I don’t necessarily have details of your medical history and all medications or supplements that you may be taking. Please do read the complete report as there is more detail about the tests and what they indicate below. Your total protein level is slightly high, and it is not possible to know what may be causing this from a blood test alone, but in isolation, it may not be significant. There are several possible reasons for this result. For example, an infection or inflammation, a problem with your liver or auto-immune disease. If you have symptoms, please discuss this result with your GP. If not, I would advise you to repeat this test in 2 months to make sure it has normalised. Your alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) liver enzymes are high and your gamma glutamyl transferase (gamma-GT) is very high. This could be due to hepatitis, cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, a blocked bile duct, medications (e.g., paracetamol, anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, cholesterol medications) or alcohol, amongst others. If you're not feeling well, you must reach out to your nearest A&E service right away. In case you are feeling well otherwise, I advise you to visit your GP as soon as possible to assess these findings and explore potential options for further testing and treatment. Your iron and ferritin (a marker of iron stores) studies suggest higher than normal blood iron levels. The recent intake of iron-rich foods and/or an iron supplement commonly causes this. However, increased ferritin levels can also be due to iron overload (haemochromatosis), excess alcohol intake, liver problems, kidney problems, infection and/or inflammation. I would advise you to discuss these results with your GP in the context of your overall health. Your total iron binding capacity and unsaturated iron binding capacity studies are high. This can occur due to not getting enough iron from your diet, blood loss and infection. I would advise you to discuss this result with your GP in the context of your overall health. Your calcium level is slightly high. You might have no symptoms at all or might suffer from symptoms like nausea, abdominal pain, constipation, bone pains or depression. Most cases of high calcium are commonly caused by problems with your parathyroid gland, vitamin D overdosing or medications. I would advise you to discuss this result with your GP. Additionally, it would be prudent to consider a repeat test in 3 weeks to make sure it has normalised. Your creatine kinase is high. This is most likely due to recent exercise but could also be a side-effect of certain medications amongst others. If you have not engaged in any physical activity recently, I would advise you to discuss this result with your GP. Your urea level is lower than normal. Urea is a breakdown product of proteins. It is removed by the kidneys and leaves the body in the urine. The most likely reasons for a decreased urea level are a low protein diet, poor absorption from your gut or drinking too much water. If you are not feeling well I would advise you to see your GP to discuss this result. If you have no symptoms I would recommend you to have this test repeated in 3 weeks time to make sure it has normalised.
[REDACTED_NAME] | 01-01-1985 | tgwajmc +44 (0)207 183 3718 www.londonmedicallaboratory.com 6 of 40 Your creatinine is in the lower range. This is often linked with muscle mass or the amount of muscle in your body which goes down with age or due to illness. Certain medications can also lower creatinine. I would advise you to discuss this result with your GP. Your triglyceride level is high. This can be caused by obesity, eating too much unhealthy food, genetics, kidney issues, diabetes or an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), amongst others. Persistently raised levels can lead to pancreatitis and heart disease. I would advise making changes to your lifestyle in order to bring this down and have the level rechecked in 4-6 weeks (ideally when fasted). Your overall cholesterol profile is high across most tests. If you are not already aware of this it may be sensible to see a doctor to consider ways to treat this. Lifestyle changes such as a healthy diet and exercise should be considered but there are times when you need more help and this can take the form of medication, especially if you also have other health concerns such as high blood pressure or if you're overweight. Your total cholesterol over HDL ratio (= cardiovascular risk calculation) is still normal because your HDL (considered "good cholesterol") is high, which is good. Even though HDL cholesterol is considered cardio- protective we would still advise lifestyle changes for elevated lipid levels in general. Below are a few lifestyle changes that might lower your lipid levels: - Eat heart-healthy foods like foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, increase soluble fibre into your diet, eliminate trans fats and reduce saturated fats - Increase your daily physical activity - lose weight if you are overweight - Drink alcohol in moderation if you drink - If you are a smoker: consider stopping smoking Your vitamin B9 (folate) level is low. While it falls within the laboratory reference range, it's crucial to highlight that values below 7.9 nmol/L are generally indicative of low body vitamin B9 stores, according to UK clinical guidelines. This result suggests potential folate deficiency, which could be because you are not getting enough in your diet, which is the most common reason. It could also be because you are not absorbing it well from your gut (e.g. due to an inflamed bowel), because of medications (e.g. aspirin or oral contraceptives) or because your needs have increased. High coffee consumption (= more than 4 cups a day) can also decrease your folate levels. Therefore, I advise you to discuss this result with your GP for further evaluation and consideration of treatment. You also might consider incorporating foods rich in vitamin B9 into your diet, such as asparagus, broccoli, brown rice, brussels sprouts, chickpeas and peas. Additionally, consider rechecking your vitamin B9 level in three months with a blood test to ensure it is improving. Your vitamin D level is deficient. This is most likely due to a lack of sunshine and/or a lack of vitamin D in your diet. Low levels can cause fatigue/tiredness, low mood, a weakened immune system and can reduce fitness. I would advise you to discuss this further with your GP as you may need a prescription-strength Vitamin D supplement. Your vitamin B12 level is low. This could be due to many reasons but may be because you're not getting enough in your diet, or not absorbing it well from your gut or because you need more vitamin B12 than you did in the past. Animal products such as meat, eggs, and shellfish are high in vitamin B12, as well as some processed foods like cereals. Vegans, and to a lesser degree vegetarians, are at risk for low levels of vitamin B12 if they do not eat foods with added vitamins (e.g. cereals) or take a vitamin supplement. I advise you to discuss this result with your GP for further evaluation and treatment. Additionally, consider incorporating vitamin B12-rich foods in your diet and B12-fortified foods (e.g., certain soy products and select breakfast cereals) or yeast extract. Booking a follow-up blood test in three months can assist in monitoring improvements in your vitamin B12 levels.
[REDACTED_NAME] | 01-01-1985 | tgwajmc +44 (0)207 183 3718 www.londonmedicallaboratory.com 7 of 40 Your testosterone level is lower than normal. It is difficult to draw any absolute conclusion after a single test result and serial testing may be required, preferably at the same time of the day and optimally around 9-10 am when testosterone is generally at its highest level. If you have symptoms (e.g., mood changes and irritability, decreased ability to exercise, fat redistribution, trouble sleeping or increased tiredness, poor concentration and short-term memory loss, amongst others), please discuss this result with your GP. If not, I would advise you to repeat the test in 3 weeks to make sure it has normalised. It is important to note that blood tests alone are not a substitute for seeing a doctor, particularly if you are feeling unwell. You should not make a diagnosis or start any treatment without a consultation with a doctor or a suitably trained healthcare professional. They always need to be interpreted in the context of the rest of your health, and this can only really be determined with a full clinical history and examination. I hope this has been helpful. Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist with. Wishing you the best of health. Dr Doctor Dr Doctor, MBBS London Medical Laboratory

Unmanaged or undiagnosed diabetes is one of the leading causes of mortality. For anyone who already knows they have diabetes, regular HbA1c checks are essential to monitor progress. Haemoglobin A1c Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test is used to measure the average level of blood sugar over the past two to three months and is commonly used to diagnose and monitor diabetes. The sugar is called glucose which builds up in the blood and binds to the haemoglobin in the red blood cells. Result Normal 37.4 mmol/mol - Normal Comment: HbA1c is accepted for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in the UK.

[REDACTED_NAME] | 01-01-1985 | tgwajmc +44 (0)207 183 3718 www.londonmedicallaboratory.com 35 of 40 Hormones Hormones are biochemical substances produced by various glands in the body, forming a part of the endocrine system. They are secreted directly into the bloodstream and travel to specific organs or tissues where they exert their effects. Hormones act as chemical messengers and play a crucial role in regulating many physiological processes in the body. Testosterone Testosterone is an important sex hormone for both men and women. In men, it is made in the testicles. In women, it is made in small amounts in the ovaries. It is important for normal male sexual development. During puberty (in the teen years), testosterone helps boys develop male features like body and facial hair, a deeper voice, and muscle strength. Too much testosterone in men can cause shrinking of the testicles, impotence, an increased risk of heart attack and prostate enlargement with difficulty urinating. Too little can cause fatigue, irritability, depression, erectile dysfunction and reduced muscle mass. Combined with oestrogen, testosterone helps with the growth, maintenance, and repair of a woman's reproductive tissues and bone mass. Too much can cause acne, excess hair on the face and body, irregular periods and mood changes. Too little can cause low libido and weight gain.
