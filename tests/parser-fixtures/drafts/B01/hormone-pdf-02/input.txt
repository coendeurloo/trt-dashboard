Higher evening/night cortisol indicates either some form of adrenal stressor(s) that is increasing a drenal gland synthesis of cortisol or supplementation with a glucocorticoid (eg. hydrocortisone used as an anti - inflammatory or some other cortisol analogue used f or treating allergies or asthma) or adrenal adaptogen that increases adrenal cortisol synthesis (eg. licorice or ginseng), The most commo n stressors include: psychological stressors (emotional), physical insults (injury, pain, diseases), chemical ex posure (environmental pol lutants, excessive medications), hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and pathogenic infections (bacterial, viral, fungal). Acute situational stresso rs (e.g., anxiety over unresolved situations, coming home from work to a stressful situation.) can also result in a transie nt increase in evening/ni ght cortisol levels, which is a normal response to the stressor. Chronic high evening/night cortisol is commonly associat ed with sleep disturbance s, fatigue, depression, weight gain in the waist, bone loss, and anxiety. This condition can also impair the act ions of other hormones su ch as insulin and thyroid, causing symptoms of their deficiency, even though the levels of these hormones may be withi n normal range (i.e., ins ulin resistance and thyroid deficiency). For additional information about strategies for supporting adrenal health and r educing stressors, the fo llowing books are worth reading: "Adrenal Fatigue", by James L. Wilson, N.D., D.C., Ph.D.; "The Cortisol Connection", by Shawn Talbott, Ph.D.; "The End of Stress As We Know It" by Bruce McEwen; "Awakening Athena" by [REDACTED_PROVIDER]. Estradiol (blood spot) is higher than range for a male, indicating excessive conversion of androgens to estrogens. Testostero ne conversion to estradiol can result from increased levels of aromatase, which is found in adipose tissue and induce d by cortisol. Testosterone (blood spot) is lower than the optimal range (400 - 1200 ng/dL). In men NOT supplementing with testosterone, the l evel/range of testosterone in whole blood derived from the dried blood spot is nearly identical to testosterone in serum from conventional venipuncture. In the bloodstream testosterone is tightly bound to Sex Hormone Binding Globulin (SHBG), rendering it less available to target tissu es. The free and bioavailable fractions of testosterone can be calculated if the total testosterone (this test) and S HBG concentrations are kn own (www.issam.ch/ freetesto.htm). This often referred to as the Free Testosterone Index (FTI). The ideal FTI for men i s 0.7 - 1.0, but levels can drop much lower in older men due to lower testosterone and higher SHBG. When testosterone values drop below about 400 n g/dL and/or the FTI is lo w, due to elevated SHBG, symptoms of andropause often are more frequent. Low testosterone in men is commonly s een beginning in the four th decade of life, and is associated with symptoms of aging. Adequate levels of testosterone are essential for a man's health and well being. Testosterone is an important anabolic hormone that helps to maintain both physical and mental health: it prevents fatigue, helps to mainta in a normal sex drive, increases the strength of all structural tissues (skin, bone, muscles, heart) and prevents de pression and mental fatig ue. Testosterone deficiency is associated with symptoms such as erectile dysfunction, decreased sex drive, and decrea sed mental and physical a bility, apathy, loss of muscle mass, and insulin resistance /metabolic syndrome. Stress management, exercise, proper nutrition, dietary suppl ements (particularly adequate zinc and selenium), and androgen replacement therapy have all been shown to r aise androgen levels in m en and help counter andropause symptoms. Testosterone therapy is worthwhile considering if symptoms of andropaus e are problematic and PSA is within normal range. SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin) is low for a man 40 and older. Low estradiol, low thyroid, and h igh insulin often are ass ociated with a low SHBG. SHBG is an indirect index of estrogen interaction with the liver when thyroid and insulin leve ls are normal. As the est rogen levels increase with aging in males there is a proportional increase in SHBG, assuming thyroid and insulin levels are normal. Howeve r, when thyroid hormone (T3) is low or is functioning less efficiently at the cellular level (most common causes are high estrogens, low prog esterone, low testosterone and low or high cortisol) hepatic induction of SHBG by estrogens is diminished. Excess insulin, caused by insuli n resistance (often

(Ordering Provider unless otherwise specified on page 1) associated with high triglycerides), also suppresses SHBG synthesis by the liver, rendering estrogen s and androgens, particul arly testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, more bioavailable. Assuming normal thyroid and insulin levels, the SHBG lev el can be used as relativ e index of overall exposure to any forms of estrogen (endogenous, pharmaceutical, xeno - estrogens). DHEAS (blood spot) is lower than the reference range. Blood DHEAS levels are highest in the late tee ns to early twenties in b oth males and females and levels steadily decline with age. The reference range spans expected levels from youth ( upper limits) to old age (lower limits). A very low DHEAS at any age could indicate adrenal dysfunction. Low DHEAS is often associated with low testosterone (DHEA is a testosterone precursor) and symptoms of androgen deficiency (fatigue, depression, low libido, loss of muscle mass , bone loss, memory lapse s). If symptoms of androgen deficiency are/become problematic consider DHEA therapy. PSA (Prostate Specfic Antigen) is within normal range. Free T4 is within normal range but free T3 is low - normal and TSH is slightly elevated. Several sympt oms (cold body temperatur e, low stamina) are consistent with lower T3 and slightly elevated TSH. Elevated TSH is expected to occur in 10% of the population, approxima tely 5% worldwide, and approximately 4 - 15% in the elderly. In the United States alone, this accounts for 13 million cases of undetect ed hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism, which presents with high TSH, normal free T4, and normal T3, is seen in the majority of hypothyro id patients. TSH values will change prior to any appearance of abnormalities in free T4 or free T3. The TSH will chan ge 100 fold for every 2 - f old change in free T4. Since the TSH "set point" appears to be individual, ideal management would include monitoring su btle fluctuations or chan ges in an individual's TSH results. 17% of subclinical hypothyroidism will progress to overt hypothyroidism. M easurement of thyroid per oxidase antibody is appropriate to help determine course of treatment. Routine screening for TSH is recommended every 5 years after age 35, or mo re frequently after age 55. Since the TSH "set point" appears to be individual, ideal management would include mon itoring subtle fluctuatio ns or changes in an individual's results. If symptoms become more problematic it would be worthwhile to consider thyr oid therapy or modificati on of any hormonal imbalances (eg. high estradiol, low progesterone, low testosterone, high or low cortisol) that might impede optimal thyroid f unction. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies are low indicating that Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis is un likely.
