Re-screen more often than every 3 years. 2h Glucose Tolerance Test is indicated if 1 or more risk fac- tors present. www.bcguidelines.ca/gpac/ pdf/diabetes_appendix_a.pdf Hemoglobin A1C Hemoglobin A1C 5.2 4.5-6.0 % Therapeutic target for most adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes is <=7.0%. In the frail elderly and patients who are prone to hypoglycemia, target is <=8.5%. A1c >=6.5% meets the criterion for type 2 diabetes mellitus in adults. See 2018 Diabetes Canada guidelines. Sodium 140 135-145 mmol/L Potassium 4.4 3.5-5.0 mmol/L Urea 7.0 2.0-9.0 mmol/L Creatinine 97 45-110 umol/L Estimated GFR 91 >=60 Units for eGFR are mL/min/1.73sq.m Kidney function estimate based on assumption of a stable serum creatinine concentration: diet, drugs, pregnancy, clinical state and muscle mass can affect accuracy of the estimate.

If triglycerides are => 1.50 mmol/L, consider monitoring of alternate lipid targets non HDL-cholest- erol or apoB. For low risk individuals with LDL cholesterol => 5.00 mmol/L, target reduction of LDL cholesterol => 50 percent. See Can J Cardiol 2013 vol 29 pgs 151 to 167. HDL Cholesterol 1.70 >0.99 mmol/L New method effective September 17,2018, with improved specificity and reduced interferences in patients with liver disease. For further information please contact the Bio-Chemist on call at 1-800-431- 7206. Chol/HDL (Risk Ratio) 3.12 <4.9 Non HDL Cholesterol 3.60 mmol/L Non HDL-cholesterol is calculated from total cholesterol and HDL-C and is not affected by the fasting status of the patient. The optimal non HDL-cholesterol level for intermediate and high risk individuals is <= 2.60 mmol/L. See Can J Cardiol 2013 vol 29 pgs 151 to 167. Triglycerides 0.52 <2.21 mmol/L Random Urine Chemistry Urine Creatinine Urine Creatinine 8.58 mmol/L No reference range has been established for this test. Urine (Micro)albumin ACR (Microalbumin/Creatinine Ratio) <1.0 <2.0 mg/mmol Note: Reference interval for albumin/creatinine ratio as per BCMA/MSC guidelines.

Tumour Markers Prostate Specific Ag 0.44 <2.5 ug/L Changes in serial PSA levels may be misleading unless all PSA tests are performed by the same laboratory. Reproductive and Gonadal Estradiol 113 <157 pmol/L NOTE: Estrogen receptor antagonists and aromatase inhibitors have been shown to interfere with estradiol testing by some immunoassay technologies resulting in falsely elevated estradiol concentra- tions. For patients taking these medica- tions, please interpret results with caution.

Sex Hormone Binding Globulin 44.1 10.0-70.0 nmol/L When assessing testosterone status, testosterone and SHBG should be tested on the same specimen. Serum Proteins C Reactive Protein (High Sensitivity) 1.0 <4.8 mg/L New reference range effective 09/11/2017. Interpretation: This high sensitivity CRP method is sensitive to 0.3 mg/L and is suitable for coronary artery disease assess- ment and detection of active inflamma- tion.
