For any patients for whom low Estradiol levels are anticipated (e.g. males, pre-pubertal children and hypogonadal/post-menopausal females), the Quest Diagnostics Nichols Institute Estradiol, Ultrasensitive, LCMSMS assay is recommended (order code 30289). Please note: patients being treated with the drug fulvestrant (Faslodex(R)) have demonstrated significant interference in immunoassay methods for estradiol measurement. The cross reactivity could lead to falsely elevated estradiol test results leading to an inappropriate clinical assessment of estrogen status. Quest Diagnostics order code 30289-Estradiol, Ultrasensitive LC/MS/MS demonstrates negligible cross reactivity with fulvestrant.
