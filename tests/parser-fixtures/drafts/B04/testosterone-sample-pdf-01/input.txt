Testosterone is produced from cholesterol via DHEA and androstenedione mainly in the testicles and adrenal glands, but also in the skin and fat cells. It promotes the release of fats from the adipose tis sue. Testosterone can be converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by the enzyme 5 - alpha - reductase. DHT is the metabolically active form of testosterone: Through DHT men get their male characteristics, such as increased body hair, beard, deep voice, etc. If t estosterone is not converted to DHT, it can be converted to oestradiol by the enzyme aromatase. Testosterone protects against accumulation of fat in the abdominal area. In men, a sufficient testosterone synthesis is crucial for performance, fat metabolism, spermatogenesis, and libido. Decreased testosterone values can, for example, be caused by inflammatory processes or blood circulation disorders. This document was issued electronically and is therefore valid without signature .
