Ricardo Salta’s blood tests February/March 2016 With suspicions of hormonal problems (testosterone, thyroid, cortisol...) being able to explain my variety of health struggles (from the head down to my feet....) • These tests were made privately at the BioScientia laboratory in Berlin, Germany • I compiled the desired tests from various websites I had been studying for a long time about Testosterone dysfunction and therapy, and did as many tests as I could believing that in this case, more is more (sometimes, less is more.....) • I believe I could still do a few more (e.g. SHBG) and expect to get some feedback and feedforward from the online community when I share this • Since the results were delivered to me in German, I did my best with Google Translate, to produce, on the side of the German words/phrases, the equivalent in English. Please consider that the English version is not supposed to be professional. • Personal stats: • - Born March 7 1983 (33 years in 2016) • - 90 kg, 1m77cm
